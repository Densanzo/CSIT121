                <p id="gcolor"><i>Published on September 14, 2025 by DS</i></p>    
            
                <p>My (we)blog for learning HTML this year. While this isn't my first time learning HTML, it has been enough time since I first learned it to find it exciting to create 
                    and practicing the language. <br>From what I knew before and prior experience with Python, Javascript, and C# I am able to enhance and elevate the way I learn by being more 
                        efficient.<br>So this is what I learned this time!</p>

                    <h3 id="hed">What I Learned</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>The first thing I learned how to provide breaks with my paragraphs for the website and to break sentences in the actual code to provide better readability 
                        for the coding source.</li>
                
                    <li>The second thing I learned was using references but when I was using the references and clicking on the links, they redirected me correctly but on the same page, 
                    <br>losing the other page and not able to look back and forth from the blog and the link so I learned how to add target="_blank" to the references to <br>instead redirect 
                        the link to a different tab. I think this will be useful in the future when used in the right context.</li>
                
                    <li>The third and last lesson I learned for this blog were the semantic elements. While I understood the general usages of tags of "p", "h", "body", and "head"
                        there were other tags <br>I remembered that I used before but forgot the context on what they were used for and how to use them so just to broaden my knowledge I learned 
                        other elements like summary, aside, and figure!</li>
                </ol>

                <h2 id="hed">My CSS Learning Process</h2>
                        <p id="gcolor"><i>Published on September 23, 2025 by DS</i></p>

                    <p>Lab 3 taught how to utilize the CSS properties to stylize my weblog and take my coding to another level. While I found lab 2 to be quite easy I did the bare minimum
                        and only did what was required, but with previous knowledge on how to use CSS I decided to go a bit beyond what was needed and provided a gif for a background,
                        change hyperlink colors and text decorations in different scenarios, and most of all I had to teach myself again what the difference between IDs and classes
                        were in HTML again. While IDs and classes in other languages are similar in theory, the syntax is a bit different especially if I was using an external style
                        sheet.</p>
                    <p>W3 schools is very prevalent in the lessons but it only taught me the very basics on how to use gifs, the size was never proportionate to what I needed and I
                        found HTML isn't intuitive enough for me to force myself through the code as I usually do in other languages, either that or I wasn't thinking enough. Since
                        I was using a gif I had to selectively find one that had a uniform color combination but even then in areas where it's lighter or darker, I had to 
                        tweak their colors to improve the readabililty while it still fits my theme. Other than that after looking up resources outside of the links provided I
                         was able to look at other lessons on platforms where they asked the same question I had and eventually it worked!</p>

                <h3 id="hed">What I Learned</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Hyperlinks were taught a little bit in class but after researching more into hyperlinks in CSS there are ALOT more properties that could be used in 
                            various ways which was extraordinary!</li>
                        <li>Background images was the next lesson I tackled and it took a couple more resources outside of the one provided for it to work since I was using a
                            gif, the work was worth it though!</li>
                        <li>This next lesson had it's basics taught in class, but learning the difference between a class and an ID was necessary so I would know which selector
                            that would be used most often. The selector I used the most was the ID selector.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>The resources are where I learned the lessons above!</p>
