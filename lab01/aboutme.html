            <p>

            <h2>Skills/Hobbies</h2>
            <p>

                My skills hobbies involve drawing and playing games. <br>I love to explore different genres and then being inspired 
                by them to draw in the style of said game. <br>A hobby and skill that feed off each other quite nicely.
