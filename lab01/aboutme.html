            <p>
            I like to play games, singleplayer games, visual novels. I also draw, traditional and digitally. I currently am in
            development of a game, just a simple visual novel to work on my story creating and world building skills. 
            I am in the middle of learning 3D modeling on blender to create a simple house for another 3D graphical design studio.
            It is not easy.
            I know how to breakdance, I like to play sports like tennis and volleyball, I also read manga and watch anime, mostly
            reading these days.
