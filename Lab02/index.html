    <h2>My Blog of My Learning Experience</h2>
        <p><i>Published on September 14, 2025 by DS</i></p>    
        
        <p>My (we)blog for learning HTML this year. While this isn't my first time learning HTML, it has been enough time since I first learned it to find it exciting to create 
        and practicing the language. <br>From what I knew before and prior experience with Python, Javascript, and C# I am able to enhance and elevate the way I learn by being more 
        efficient.<br>So this is what I learned this time!</p>

    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>The first thing I learned how to provide breaks with my paragraphs for the website and to break sentences in the actual code to provide better readability 
            for the coding source.</li>
            
            <li>The second thing I learned was using references but when I was using the references and clicking on the links, they redirected me correctly but on the same page, 
            <br>losing the other page and not able to look back and forth from the blog and the link so I learned how to add target="_blank" to the references to <br>instead redirect 
            the link to a different tab. I think this will be useful in the future when used in the right context.</li>
            
            <li>The third and last lesson I learned for this blog were the semantic elements. While I understood the general usages of tags of "p", "h", "body", and "head"
            there were other tags <br>I remembered that I used before but forgot the context on what they were used for and how to use them so just to broaden my knowledge I learned 
            other elements like summary, aside, and figure!</li>
        </ol> 

        <p>The links provided below are where I learned 1, 2, and 3!</p>
